    <p><a href="index.html">Back to Ordinal Layers</a></p>
    <p>Ordinal Layers is an Incremental Game which involves making an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinal</a> grow bigger and bigger. You might be confused to what are ordinals, but don't worry, we will guide you.</p>
    <p><b>WARNING: THIS GUIDE CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!</b></p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>When you start the game, you should see a number in the form of H<sub>ordinal</sub>(10). You can click a button to increase the ordinal by 1. The number should go up. When your number reaches 20, you can maximize the ordinal. Your ordinal will increase to &omega;, pronounced <i>omega</i>. Omega is the first infinite ordinal. After &omega;, you can increase the ordinal even more, but the number goes up faster. At &omega;+10, you can maximize to &omega;2. &omega;2+10 maximizes to &omega;3 and so on. At &omega;9+10, you can maximize to &omega;<sup>2</sup>, which is omega multiplied by itself. Your number reaches 10240, and you can now Markup!</p>
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>When you Markup, you reset your ordinal, but you gain Ordinal Points (OP) based on your ordinal. You can spend your OP on autoclickers and factors.</p>
    <h3>Autoclickers</h3>
    <p>Autoclickers automate your progress. You can automate increasing the ordinal or maximizing the ordinal. They both cost OP.</p>
    <h3>Factors</h3>
    <p>Factors multiply your autoclicker speed! They cost OP to upgrade. You start with zero factors, but you can do Factor Shifts to gain factors.</p>
    <h3>Factor Shifts</h3>
    <p>When you reach the required OP, you can do a Factor Shift. It will reset everything before it, but you gain a new factor and the base decreases by 1. Bases are ways to reach larger ordinals from smaller ordinals. For example, at base 10, &omega;<sup>3</sup> requires &omega;<sup>2</sup>9+&omega;9+10. In base 4, you only need &omega;<sup>2</sup>3+&omega;3+4 and at very low bases, bases can be quite overpowered. You can turn &omega;<sup>2</sup>2+&omega;2+3 into &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> in base 3!</p>
