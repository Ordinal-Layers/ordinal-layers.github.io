    <p><a href="index.html">Back to Ordinal Layers</a></p>
    <p>Ordinal Layers is an Incremental Game which involves making an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinal</a> grow bigger and bigger. You might be confused to what are ordinals, but don't worry, we will guide you.</p>
    <p><b>WARNING: THIS GUIDE CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!</b></p>

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>When you start the game, you should see a number in the form of H<sub>ordinal</sub>(10). You can click a button to increase the ordinal by 1. The number should go up. When your number reaches 20, you can maximize the ordinal. Your ordinal will increase to &omega;, pronounced <i>omega</i>. Omega is the first infinite ordinal. After &omega;, you can increase the ordinal even more, but the number goes up faster. At &omega;+10, you can maximize to &omega;2. &omega;2+10 maximizes to &omega;3 and so on. At &omega;9+10, you can maximize to &omega;<sup>2</sup>, which is omega multiplied by itself. Your number reaches 10240, and you can now Markup!</p>
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>When you Markup, you reset your ordinal, but you gain Ordinal Points (OP) based on your ordinal. You can spend your OP on autoclickers and factors.</p>
    <h3>Autoclickers</h3>
    <p>Autoclickers automate your progress. You can automate increasing the ordinal or maximizing the ordinal. They both cost OP.</p>
    <h3>Factors</h3>
    <p>Factors multiply your autoclicker speed! They cost OP to upgrade. You start with zero factors, but you can do Factor Shifts to gain factors.</p>
    <h3>Factor Shifts</h3>
    <p>When you reach the required OP, you can do a Factor Shift. It will reset everything before it, but you gain a new factor and the base decreases by 1. Bases are ways to reach larger ordinals from smaller ordinals. For example, at base 10, &omega;<sup>3</sup> requires &omega;<sup>2</sup>9+&omega;9+10. In base 4, you only need &omega;<sup>2</sup>3+&omega;3+4 and at very low bases, bases can be quite overpowered. You can turn &omega;<sup>2</sup>2+&omega;2+3 into &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> in base 3!</p>
    <h3>&psi;(1)</h3>
    <p>When you reach &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup>, the game switches to Buchholz's OCF. At this point, you can buy autoclickers and Markup to reach larger ordinals! Just Max All autoclickers and then click Markup repeatedly to proceed! When you reach &psi;(&Omega;), you can do a Factor Boost.<p>
    <h2>Factor Boosts</h2>
    <p>Factor Boosts give you Boosters to spend on Booster Upgrades! Your first one gives 1 Booster. The next one gives 2, then 3, 4, and so on. However, the prices increase rapidly, making 4 and more boosters hard to get.</p>
    <h3>Upgrade Table</h3>
    <p>The Upgrade Table is a table of upgrades! They cost boosters to unlock. If you want to change your upgrades, you can Refund! Refunding gives you 100% of your boosters back. The only cost of refunding is that it resets everything in the current Factor Boost, but you can try a different build.</p>
    <h3>Autobuyers</h3>
    <p>Autobuyers can be bought from the Upgrade Table. They automate higher aspects of the game. Max All autobuyer maxes out all autoclickers and factors every second. It stops when you're able to do a Factor Shift. Markup autobuyer performs a Markup every second, if it can and the ordinal is high enough. Autobuyers can be sped up by later upgrades.</p>
