    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>When you start the game, you should see a number in the form of H<sub>ordinal</sub>(10). You can click a button to increase the ordinal by 1. The number should go up. When your number reaches 20, you can maximize the ordinal. Your ordinal will increase to &omega;, pronounced <i>omega</i>. Omega is the first infinite ordinal. After &omega;, you can increase the ordinal even more, but the number goes up faster. At &omega;+10, you can maximize to &omega;2. &omega;2+10 maximizes to &omega;3 and so on. At &omega;9+10, you can maximize to &omega;<sup>2</sup>, which is omega multiplied by itself. Your number reaches 10240, and you can now Markup!</p>
    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>When you Markup, you reset your ordinal, but you gain Ordinal Points (OP) based on your ordinal. You can spend your OP on autoclickers.</p>
    <h3>Autoclickers</h3>
    <p>Autoclickers automate your progress. You can automate increasing the ordinal or maximizing the ordinal. They both cost OP.</p>
